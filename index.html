        About Calakmul
      </h2>
      <p>
        Calakmul was for hundreds of years the capital of the Mayan world. Its influence 
        stretched thousands of miles, from the northern coast of the Yucatan peninsula
        south towards present-day Guatamala, home of its principal rival Tikal. Today
        Calakmul, one of three UNESCO world heritage sites in the Yucatan, is the largest 
        and most impressive Mayan site, containing thousands of
        structures, some uncovered but most remaining hidden for now and, perhaps, for ever.
        Among these ruins is the iconic Structure II, the largest pyramid in the
        Yucatan.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets Calakmul apart from the many other Mayan sites in the Yucatan is its setting.
        It is as far away from civilization as it is possible to get in Mexico, located in the
        center of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, the largest nature reserve in the country. 
        The result is a unique combination
        of natural beauty and ancient history: howler and spider monkeys throng the ruins, while
        more reclusive fauna such as jaguars, pumas, and tapirs lurk just out of sight. A few miles away
        three million bats sleep in a small cave, from which they erupt at dusk every evening.

            Visiting Calakmul
      </h2>
      <p>
        Calakmul's remote location &#8212; 60 kilometers from the nearest town &#8212; presents
        a challenge for travellers, with the result that currently only a handful of intrepid visitors
        enter the site each day. Most of the nearest hotels have no internet presence and no
        English-speaking staff. Only a handful of hotels in the area cater to foreign tourists, and as
        a result can charge more or less whatever they'd like. Many of the trails within the Reserve
        are not signposted &#8212; in fact, some of the most impressive locations for spotting wildlife are 
        even deliberately obscured to prevent visitors without guides from accessing them. Having a guide is,
        therefore, crucial for getting the most out of visiting Calakmul. Unfortunately, there are only a
        few English-speaking guides in the area. During the high season it is particularly essential that
        you book a guide in advance.
